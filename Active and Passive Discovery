The purpose of this laboratory environment is to provide a controlled and safe setting for learning and practicing network security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing techniques. It allows students to explore and analyze security vulnerabilities, test exploit mitigation strategies, and compare the results of different security tools such as Nmap and Nessus, without risking production systems or real-world networks.
